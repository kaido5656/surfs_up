Demonstrating SQLite and flask application


### Purpose
  The purpose of this analyis was to assist and demonstrate various data to W.Avy and other board members to ensure financial backing to start and open several Surfing and ice creams shops in Oahu. The analysis was done using SQLite in jupyter notebook and presented using flask. W.Avy asked to see specific weather data pertinent to Oahu to determine whether or not the decision to open surf shops there had merit. After demonstrating to W.Avy the precipatation, temperature and most active weather station on Oahu, I was tasked further with retrieving weather data for the months of June and December to further solidify W.Avy's interest in investing in this future venture.
